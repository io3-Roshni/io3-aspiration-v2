                    during the trip?</h1>
                    <h1>A. There are 5 rules to avoid Coronavirus. You
                        should follow and apply this to your loved ones
                        during the trip. </h1>
          <ol>
            <li> Always wear a mask in a crowded place.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands from both sides with good quality handwash certified by medical
                professionals.</li>
                <li>Carry a sanitizer with you after touching anything then sanitize your hands properly.</li>
                <li>Maintain at least one-meter distance with everybody if not possible then leave that place
                    immediately and search for the safe place.</li>
                    <Li>If you and your tripmates like friends, or a family member feel something awkward then
                        immediately call for medical help and get checked.</Li>
          </ol>
                        <h1>Q. How to get medical help immediately?</h1>

                        instantly. If you feel uncomfortable then do not start your trip because in between the trip, at some
                        places it will be very hard to reach for medical help.</p>
